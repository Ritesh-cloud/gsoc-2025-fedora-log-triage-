## Project Title: AI-Powered Log Triage and Security Alert Aggregator for Fedora

### Overview
This repository contains my GSoC 2025 proposal and initial prototype for the Fedora project focused on building a system to intelligently classify and group security-related system logs using AI/ML techniques.

### Project Goals
- Classify logs using machine learning (normal, warning, critical)
- Group similar alerts using clustering
- Build a CLI/dashboard for alert monitoring
- Integrate with Fedora’s logging systems (journald, syslog, etc.)

### Repository Contents
- `proposal/`: My GSoC proposal in both Markdown and PDF formats.
- `prototype/`: Initial work, including a sample log parser, a classification notebook, and test data.
- `sample_logs/`: Sample system logs for testing.
- `LICENSE`: MIT License (or preferred open-source license)

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / SpaCy
- Pandas / NumPy
- Flask (optional for dashboard)
